## Project: **BitCollateral Stablecoin on ZetaChain**

**Description:**  
Leverage the ZRC-20 Bitcoin capabilities to introduce a stablecoin system where Bitcoin acts as collateral. The stablecoin (let's call it `ZetaUSD` or `zUSD` for short) will maintain a peg to the US Dollar. Users can deposit Bitcoin to mint zUSD and can also burn zUSD to retrieve their collateralized Bitcoin.

### Components:

1. **BTC Deposit & zUSD Minting**: 

    - Users deposit Bitcoin which gets represented as ZRC-20 on ZetaChain.
    - For every deposited BTC, a predetermined amount of zUSD is minted based on the current BTC/USD price. This might be slightly less than the market value to account for price volatility and maintain the peg.
    
2. **zUSD Burning & BTC Withdrawal**:

    - Users can burn their zUSD tokens to retrieve the equivalent BTC collateral, adjusted for current BTC/USD prices.

3. **Price Oracle Integration**:

    - Integrate a decentralized price oracle to fetch the real-time BTC/USD price.
    - Ensures fair and accurate BTC collateralization rates and zUSD minting/burning.

4. **zUSD Trading**:

    - Users can trade zUSD for other ZRC-20 tokens on ZetaChain.
    - Enhances liquidity and usability of zUSD in the ZetaChain ecosystem.

5. **Liquidation Mechanism**:

    - If the price of BTC drops significantly, a liquidation mechanism will trigger to ensure zUSD remains pegged to the USD.
    - Users whose BTC collateral falls below a certain threshold will be partially liquidated to maintain the system's integrity.

6. **Cross-chain Withdrawals**:

    - Users can swap their ZRC-20 represented BTC for other tokens like ETH, MATIC, BNB, and then withdraw them to their respective native chains.

### Implementation:

1. **Smart Contracts on ZetaChain**:

    - Develop a set of smart contracts to handle BTC deposits, zUSD minting/burning, and collateral management.
    - Incorporate the ZRC-20 capabilities to enable BTC representation on ZetaChain.
    
2. **Price Oracle**:

    - Integrate a reliable decentralized price oracle (e.g., Chainlink) to ensure accurate BTC/USD pricing.
    - Set up regular updates and price checks to avoid any manipulation or sudden price shocks.

3. **Liquidation Protocol**:

    - Design and test the liquidation mechanism, ensuring it operates fairly and only in extreme market conditions.

4. **Front-end Interface**:

    - Develop a user-friendly interface for users to deposit BTC, mint/burn zUSD, and manage their collateral.
    - Offer a dashboard for users to track the current BTC/USD price, their collateral value, and the zUSD market cap.

5. **Integration with ZetaChain's Ecosystem**:

    - Ensure seamless trading of zUSD with other ZRC-20 tokens.
    - Enable easy withdrawal of ZRC-20 tokens to their native chains using ZetaChain's omnichain capabilities.

### Potential Benefits:

- **Enhanced Utility for Bitcoin**: Users can leverage their Bitcoin holdings to participate in the ZetaChain ecosystem without selling their BTC.
  
- **Stability in ZetaChain**: Introducing a stablecoin pegged to the USD provides a stable medium of exchange and store of value for ZetaChain users.
  
- **Increased Liquidity**: As more users collateralize their Bitcoin to mint zUSD, the liquidity of the ZetaChain ecosystem will increase, promoting more decentralized applications and use cases.

This project, by combining the unique capabilities of ZRC-20 Bitcoin and the demand for stablecoins, can create significant value and utility in the ZetaChain ecosystem.
